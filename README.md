# Complex_number
This is the frst lab session exercise on creating a class of Complex and for it's operation.

- The first exercise includes to create a class of Complex numbers
- Define appropriate data members
- Define Constructors
- Define Getter, Setter
- Define the Data Members (Funtions) --> Re(), Im(), Mag(), Phase(), r(), phi()


- So we have to create a header file(Declearations. ie, Rules of the game) --> Complex.h
- Then a source file(Implementation. ie, How the game works)---> Complex.cc
- Finally a main file (to check the game actually works)---> Complex.cpp
